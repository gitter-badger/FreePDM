# FreePDM Skeleton
A PDM for FreeCAD


## Skeleton
* Reading the files for meta-data and storing the meta-data in the DB
* Modifying the meta-data
* Select material and surface finish and calculate the weight of the part
* Dealing with users. Who did what? (this can be dealth with the meta-data DB)
* Partnumbering
* Adding an owner, checker, approver
* Dealing with the history of the parts (this can be dealth with the meta-data DB)
* Dealing with the -three- assembly types. I am sure that they all have their own quirks
* Dealing with other info (such as LidbreOffice files and other media)
* Adding, Renaming and deleting files. Renaming can be tricky when the file is used in assemblies.
* Replacing files in assemblies
* Dealing with versions (IMO this can be dealt with the data DB)
* Disable files with a disable state (again in the data DB)
* Dealing with states (temporary ones, before putting into a release), again in the data DB
* Dealing with checkin and checkout (in the data DB and meta-data DB)
* Importing and exporting files (in the data DB and meta-data DB)
* Dealing with projects (creating, modifying, closing, re-opening) in the data DB
* Dealing with a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, trython, sqlite ?) I think about PostgreSQL since I now know about SQLAlchemy. But sqlite to start with.
* Use SQLAlchemy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLAlchemy
